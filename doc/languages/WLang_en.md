# WLang Programming Language

WLang language is designed according to C++, C#, Java, and so on.
WLang focuses on the high-level conceptions of programming,
and is suitable for cooperation. WLang keeps the high efficiency of executive
comapred with C++.

## Unified Programming Model

The computer techniques have changed the world with the development in recent years.
The computer program is the basic element of computation.
The essence of program is communicating with computer, i.e., requiring the computing resources
and representing the results.
The computing resources is a kind of service, including data and algorithms,
corresponding to the memory/disk (data storage) and CPU instruction flow (algorithms).
Data and algorithms are all computing resource services.
Using classes to describe the computing resources is reasonable
because the class includes data and algorithms.
A class can contain data or algorithms only and be defined recursively.
WLang is designed on the basis of classes.

Because the computing resource services are designed as classes and objects,
the global objects and the single functions are not necessary and replaced by
the static members and the static methods of classes.
This design can classify the global objects and the single functions
according to their conceptions.

## Grammar

### Comment

The comment of WLang is the same as C++ with two types, /**/ and //.

### The Basic Data Types

The basic data types of WLang are shown as follows:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
|char| signed character, 1 byte |
|byte| unsigned character, 1 byte |
|short| signed short integer, 2 bytes |
|ushort| unsigned short integer, 2 bytes |
|int| signed integer, 4 bytes |
|uint| unsigned integer, 4 bytes |
|int64| signed 64-bit integer, 8 bytes |
|uint64| unsigned 64-bit integer, 8 bytes |
|float| single precision float, 4 bytes |
|double| double precision float, 8 bytes |
|intptr| signed pointer integer, 4 bytes on 32-bit machine, 8 bytes on 64-bit machine |
|uintptr| unsigned pointer integer, 4 bytes on 32-bit machine, 8 bytes on 64-bit machine |
|bool| boolean, 1 byte |
|guid| global unique identifier, 16 bytes |

where, bool type can be assigned as true and false. A bool type is a logical expression
which represents the false logic as its value is false, and vice versa.

### Composite Types

WLang has two composite types: array and class. Array is also a type of "class"
with the replicated pattern. Class is a free-extended pattern. The basic data types
are also regarded as "class". Class can be considered as uniform type.

Because the different operations may be applied to the same data elements in an array,
e.g., comparing two strings with case-sensitive or case-insensitive, the array type
needs to be defined as special template form.

The array type can be defined as follows:

```
//fixed-length array
A[10] a;
A[10]<SpecialCompareTrait<A>> a;
//dynamic array
share A[] a;
weak A[] a2;
```

Enumerator is a special type which is compatible with integer. Only specified values
can be assigned to the enumerator variable. An enumerator can be defined as follows:

```
enum StreamOpenFlags
{
	Read = 0x00000001U;
...
}
```

### Constant

Constant can be defined for each data type except share and share array.
The constants of the basic data types are shown as follows:

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|char,short,int,int64,intptr|Number(s)|
|byte,ushort,uint,uint64,uintptr|Number(s)+U|
|float|Number(s)+.+Number(s)+\[e+-Number(s)\]+f|
|double|Number(s)+.+Number(s)+\[e+-Number(s)\]|
|guid|{8-4-4-4-12}(hex numbers)|

When the constants are represented by hexadecimal numbers, they use the prefix of 0x.

The constants can be defined as follows:

```
const int c_Num(5);
```

The composite constants can be defined by a list embraced with curly braces.
Commas are used to seperate the items. list can be defined recursively.

The constant array can be defined as follows:

```
const int[] c_arr = { 0, 1, 2 };
```

The constants must be defined in class or method body similar to static variables.

The string constants are defined by a pair of quotation marks.

The escape characters:

|Symbols|Description|Values|
|-------|-----------|------|
|\a| bell | 007 |
|\b| backspace | 008 |
|\f| form feed | 012 |
|\n| line feed | 010 |
|\r| carriage return | 013 |
|\t| horizontal tab | 009 |
|\v| vertical tab | 011 |
|\\| backslash | 092 |
|\'| single quote mark | 039 |
|\"| quotation mark | 034 |
|\0| null | 000 |
|\ddd| one to three octal digits | 3-digit octal number |
|\xhh| one to two hexadecimal digits | 2-digit hexadecimal number |

### Namespace

The namespace organizes the classes to a hierarchical structure according to conceptions.
The namespace can be defined recursively. A namespace can be considered as a degraded class.
The definitions of WLang classes must locate in a namespace.

A namespace can be defined as follows:

```
namespace UI {
...
}
```

### Class and Object

*Class* is a basic unit for providing service and an uniform programming model.
*Object* is an instance of *Class*.

Class has a qualifier (private or public) for describing the visibility
in namespace.

The parameters of method have the qualifier `in`, `out`, `inout` and pass the references.
The return value passes an object value.

Class can be defined recursively to form a hierarchical structure according to conceptions.

Class consists of three elements: property, method and event. Property and method
have three visibility qualifiers: private, protected and public.
Event consists of one or more interfaces with `event` keyword.
Use `fire` keyword to trigger the events.

Member object and static member object.

After the declaration of method, `nothrow` qualifier can be added to
ensure the method should not throw any exceptions.

`static` qualifier can be used to declare a static method which is not relative
to instance of class.

Class can be defined in a method.

WLang enables multi-inheritance with several base classes the same having alias.
Using alias and field symbol `::` to call these methods of base classes.
The method can overwrite the implementation of base class by adding `override`
qualifier and optional field symbol.

WLang only has public inheritance.

Class and methods can be designed as template form. The parameter of template
can be type, integer constant and enumerator constant.

The object can be defined as reference form (ref, share, weak).

The fetch and assignment of ref object must conform the life cycle.
The reference objects could not be defined directly, they must be accessed
by the property of wrapped class. Property has two types: reference and
object itself. Ref object cannot be fetched from share object and weak object.

The memory model of object:
A class is running through the object instance except the static member method.

An object will occupy some memory and its data will form the memory layout
except the static member object.

|Memory manager in process|Description|
|-------------------------|-----------|
|Stack|Local variables, including objects, reference objects, shared objects and weak objects|
|Heap|The memory managed by shared objects, weak objects and some reference objects|
|Global Data|Static objects or constant objects, the static member object in class|
|Uninitialized Data|The static object in method|

The running model of object:
The data managed by object can be located in memory or device memory
(such as graphics adapter memory) while the program is running.
The object also can manage the persistent storage (disk file or virtual device).

|In process|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|The kernel space|Various kernel objects, such as shared memory. No support for driver programming|
|Assemblies|The object occupies the stack and heap providing by process|
|The executable assemblies|The object occupies the stack and heap providing by process|

|Intraprocess|Description|
|------------|-----------|
|The remote assemblies|The proxy object occupies the stack and heap providing by process, the service object occupies the stack and heap providing by local or remote host process|

The copy constructor, assignment operator and move operator of object are
implemented by default. The dereference object of reference object is
the default behavior of object operation.
Use ref() operator to get the reference semantics of reference object (shallow copy).
Use clone() operator to copy a reference object (deep copy).
Use is_null() operator to determine a null reference object.

Use as operator to take the type cast. A type can be casted to other basic types,
base class, derived class (by template parameter).
The reference object can be casted directly.
A component object object can be casted to an interface object with
the query implementation.

Constructor can be defined. The default constructor, copy constructor, move constructor,
assignment operator, move assignment operator and destructor are implemented automatically.

The return type can be `weak ref` for the special wrapper using third party library.

Exception.

### Interface

Interface defining by `interface` keyword consists of public property and method
without visibility qualifier.

A derived class can be inherited from interface and implement the interface method
with override qualifier.

Implement callback mechanism.

### Component

Components have the types of in-process, out-of-process and network.

Components support `as` operator to obtain other interfaces.

Implement several kinds of event sets, i.e., connection points.
This is a knid of observer pattern.

Marshal and Unmarshal.

Implement the plug-in system.

## The Basic Class Library


### Data Structure

Data structure is only designed in System namespace and enable data casted from
intptr, uintptr to reference object. Data structure can use MemoryPool class and
conform the life cycle.

Data structure and array use iterators to access the elements in collection.
Use auto_type keyword to define the iterator object.

### Thread and Synchronization

They are done in application layer.

Synchronization between threads.

Several thread models.

### Process and Synchronization

Synchronization between processes.

Communication between processes.
